# SPSE
My solutions to the SecurityTube SPSE exercises

I started the course 3 years ago and then work ate my life.  I will be finishing it up by the end of the summer 2017.

When I started the course, I was very much the Python newbie.  I now consider myself a very proficient Python coder/developer.  As you look through my exercise answers, you will see my coding style change and grwo.

Feel free to look at the code for ideas, but do not take or use the code as your own (you'll only be cheating yourself).

All the code is written using Python 2.7.x, unless otherwise indicated.
